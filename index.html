      <h3><b>The Beginning Of Code</b></h3>
      <p>He <span>introduced me to code</span>, I began with <span>HTML & CSS</span>. I built a <span>website</span> for young <span>badminton players</span>. <a href="http://surreystars.comli.com">surreystars</a>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family:Brush Script Std; font-size:30pt;">Dispair</p>
      <p>After creating my website, I met with another friend of mine who had also built a website however using content
      from an of the shelf site. Upon showing me I was shocked at how much better and interactive his site was to mine and all
      at the fraction of the time i had put in. I was devistated. Was all my time spent wasted? Could I not use an off the shelf
      platform to create my website? Wouldn't it be soo much easier? I was on the verge of stopping to learn to code, for it seemed
      unnessary. Meeting with my friend who introduced me to coding he quickly laughed and smiled, he said "creating a website is just
      the beginning" he mentioned to me about machine learning & AI. Upon this discovery i reserched into some of these fields. I saw the
      works of Elon Musk, Zuckerburg and regained my wonder and marvel all the while knowing I will always be on a stepping stone to a
      limitless journey.</p>
